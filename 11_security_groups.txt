# Setting up security groups

# A security group is essentially firewall rules
# Setting up security groups is necessary to allow access to specific ports on our instances
# Without access to ports 5901 (VNC), 22 (SSH), we would not be able to access our isntances.

# Navigate to the dashboard - Compute > Access and Security 
# Create security group
# Give the group a name
osn_access_rules

# Give the group a description
Rules to access instances via SSH and VNC.

# Click Manage Rules
# Egress gives access to anything when remote is set to 0.0.0.0
# By default there are no rules

# Add a rule for SSH (port 22)
# Click Add Rule
# For the Rule dropdown, select SSH
# Remote, select CIDR
# CIDR, select 0.0.0.0/0     
# Making the CIDR 0.0.0.0/0 means anyone can access it from anywhere
# Click Add


# Add a rule for HTTPS (port 443)
# Click Add Rule
# For the Rule dropdown, select HTTPS
# Remote, select CIDR
# CIDR, select 0.0.0.0/0     
# Making the CIDR 0.0.0.0/0 means anyone can access it from anywhere
# Click Add

# Add a rule for HTTP (port 80)
# Click Add Rule
# For the Rule dropdown, select HTTP
# Remote, select Security Group
# For Security Group, select our access rules we just made
# Security Group, select osn_access_rules (current)

# Add a rule for ICMP (any port)
# Click Add Rule
# For the Rule dropdown, select ALL ICMP
# Remote, select CIDR
# CIDR, select 0.0.0.0/0     
# Making the CIDR 0.0.0.0/0 means anyone can access it from anywhere
# Click Add


# Now we must set up keys so that we can access these images via SSH without passwords
# Compute > Access Security > +Create Key Pair
# This will prompt you to download a .pem key
# We will need this .pem key soon
