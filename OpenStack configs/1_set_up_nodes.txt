You need 3 nodes -
compute node
controller node
network node

# Initially these 3 nodes have identical set ups. Please follow the 
# instructions below on all 3 nodes.

# Must be running NTP
yum -y install chrony
systemctl start chronyd
systemctl enable chronyd

# Must be set up to use the OpenStack repo
yum install centos-release-openstack-liberty

# Install the OpenStack client
yum install python-openstackclient

# Stop and disable NetworkManager and firewalld
systemctl stop NetworkManager
systemctl disable NetworkManager
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld

# To ensure your network is not being controlled by NetworkManager,
# Make sure that your /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-e* has:
NM_CONTROLLED=no

# Disable selinux
vim /etc/selinux/config
SELINUX=disabled

# Set the hostname - give the host an appropriate name - either compute.pitt.edu,
# network.pitt.edu, OR controller.pitt.edu 
vim /etc/hostname

# Edit the file with ONE of the following
compute.pitt.edu
network.pitt.edu
controller.pitt.edu

# Create the host file 
# This lets our host communicate via hostname rather than IP addresses
vim /etc/hosts

# Edit the file with all of the following
192.168.0.101  compute          compute.pitt.edu
192.168.0.102  network          network.pitt.edu
192.168.0.103  controller       controller.pitt.edu

# Install packstack
yum -y install openstack-packstack

# Run an upgrade
yum upgrade
