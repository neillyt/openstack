# Adding projects (tenants = projects, they are synonymous and entirely interchangeable)
# A project is an assigned number of OpenStack users or resources
# Preparing to launch an instance

# Open the Horizon dashboard (use the IP address of your Controller node if it does not have a DNS record)
Click Identity
Click +Create Project
Give the project a name and description
Select quota and set them accordingly

# Each project can have a quota that allows them to have a set amount of resources such as IP addresses, RAM,
# CPU, disk space, instances, etc. This gives us control over who uses what. For example, if a department wants
# to use our OpenStack instance, we can limit them and prevent them from using too many resources.


# Managing projects
# Using the keystone CLI we can manage our projects.
source ~/keystonerc_admin

# To get help with keystone:
keystone help
keystone help <command>

# To see all of the projects that have already been created:
keystone tenant-list

# This can also be viewed and controlled also using the Horizon GUI

# In keystone CLI, let's create a tenant:
keystone tenant-create --name Test --description "Our first tenant!" --enabled true

# Deleting a project from keystone CLI - first get the ID from the tenant-list
keystone tenant-list
keystone tenant-delete --id=<id from list>

# You can also update a project under the 'Actions' column and by clicking 'modify users'
# We can add/subtract project users
