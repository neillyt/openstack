# Flavors
# Useful files: controller node: /etc/nova/policy.json

# A flavor is a default size that an instance can be
# By default, there are 5 flavors

# Name		vCPU	RAM	Root Disk Size
# m1.tiny		1	512MB	1GB
# m1.small	1	2048MB	20GB
# m1.medium	2	4096MB	40GB
# m1.large	4	8192MB	80GB
# m1.xlarge	8	16384MB	160GB

# You can edit and create your own custom flavors:
# You can change memory or capacity to suit your needs.

# Log into OpenStack as an admin user, click the Admin tab at the top
# Click the Flavors tab
# Here you have the options of editing the flavors
# This is pretty self explanatory

# Flavor access determines which projects can spin up instances using this flavor

# On the controller node, take a look at the /etc/nova/policy.json
# search for compute_extension:flavormanage
# This is the rule that determines who can manage flavors. By default it's set to admin.
# To change a rule so that everyone can do something, simply remove the rule
# For no rule, you should see - "compute_extension:flavormanage": ""
# In order for the policy changes to take effect, we must restart the nova api
# systemctl restart openstack-api-nova

# Creating flavors from the CLI
# Example:
nova flavor-create --is-public true m1.example auto 256 0 1 --rxtx-factor .1

# Let me break the following command into sections:
# nova flavor-create = the command
# --is-public true = everyone can use this flavor
# m1.example = the name of the flavor
# auto =
# 256 = amount of memory in MB
# 0 = disk
# 1 = vcpu
# rxtx-favor .1 = sets the rxtx-factor to .1

# Now let's look at the list of flavors again
