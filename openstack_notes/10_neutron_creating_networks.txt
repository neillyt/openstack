# Neutron
# Before we can spin up our first instance, we need to make the network



# Here is a reminder of our entire network
# subnet is /27 255.255.255.224
# 136.142.139.128	network address ------------
# 136.142.139.129	default gateway	-------------
# 136.142.139.130	hiphost		hiphost.cist.pitt.edu
# 136.142.139.131	hipchat		cloud.cist.pitt.edu
# 136.142.139.140	controller	controller.cist.pitt.edu
# 136.142.139.141	compute	compute.cist.pitt.edu
# 136.142.139.142	network		network.cist.pitt.edu
# 136.142.139.159	broadcast address ----------


# We need the following: router, network, subnets private/public, 
# add an interface to the router for our subnet, set any public
# subnets by defining the router's gateway

# When we have accomplished this, we will be able to assign a 
# "floating IP address" to instances





###################### Create a network
###################### Configure our private network
# Using the web dashboard, navigate to Compute > Networks > +Create Network
# Give the network a name
osn_private

# Give the subnet a name
osn_private_sub

# Give the subnet a network address (this is your private network)
192.168.0.0/24

# Give the default gateway an address
# By default the gateway will be the first address after the network address on the network - 192.168.0.1
# If you want your gateway to be the default, leave field blank
# If you want your gateway to have a different address, add it now

# Allocation Pools, DNS Name Servers, and Host Routes can be left blank

######################

###################### Creating the Public network
# Click Create Network on the web dashboard
# Give the network a name
osn_public

# Give the subnet network a name
osn_public_subnet

# Give the subnet your network address (your physical default gateway that routes you to the internet)
# Remember your network address is the beginning of your network
136.142.139.128/27

# Give the gateway IP of your physical gateway
136.142.139.129

# Allocation pools - this is very important as we must be careful to not allocate
# addresses that are already used! Like for the HipChat server or the OpenStack nodes themselves
# Give each range seperated by a common. 1 range per line.
136.142.139.133,136.142.139.139
136.142.139.145,136.142.139.158

# DNS Name Servers and Host Routes can be left alone
# Create

#########################





######################### Make our network an external network

# Log in as admin
# On the left side of the dashboard, navigate to Admin > Networks > osn_public > Edit Network
# Click 'external network' and Save Changes
# You can now log out and back in as normal account if desired

#########################





######################### Create a Router

# Navigate to Project > Network > Routers > +Create Router
# Give the router a name
osn_router

# Assign the router the External Network you created
osn_public

# Now back into Project > Network > Routers and click on osn_router
# We must add an interface. 
# Click Add Interface
# Click the drop down for Subnet* and choose our private subnet
osn_private
# Do not bother adding an IP address

# Now we need to set our gateway on the router
# Navigate to Project > Network > Network Topology - this will help us visualize things
# Right now our public subnet is not yet attached to the router
# We first need to set our gateway to the external network
# Go back to Project > Network > Routers, under actions choose "Set Gateway"
# From the External Network drop down, select 'osn_public'
