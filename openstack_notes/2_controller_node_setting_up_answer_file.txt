# Controller node set up
# After completing the initial set up on all 3 nodes, follow these directions
# for the controller node

# Create the packstack answer file
packstack --gen-answer-file /root/answers.txt

# Take a look at the answers.txt file
# This file tells the PackStack script which services to install and not install
cat /root/answers.txt

# Only the settings explicitly listed are to be changed. All other settings can
# maintain their default status

# Open the answers.txt file and lets set our IP addresses correctly to the hosts
# This is very important to assign the correct IP addresses because the PackStack
# script actually ssh's into these hosts to install the correct components
# My set up will look like this:
vim answers.txt
CONFIG_CONTROLLER_HOST=192.168.0.103
CONFIG_COMPUTE_HOSTS=192.168.0.101
CONFIG_NETWORK_HOSTS=192.168.0.102

# If the AMQP backend is not set to rabbitmq, do so
CONFIG_AMQP_BACKEND=rabbitmq

# The controller node will double as the AMQP (Advanced Message Queue Protocol)
# server (RabbitMQ) as well as the Database server (MariaDB)
# Make sure the config is set accordingly to reflect the Controller IP for these
# entries
CONFIG_AMQP_HOST=192.168.0.103
CONFIG_MARIADB_HOST=192.168.0.103

# Let's set the MariaDB to use the root account and set the password to "Panther$"
CONFIG_MARIADB_PW=Panther$

# Set "The token to use for the Keystone service api" to pittpanther16 (lowercase)
CONFIG_KEYSTONE_ADMIN_TOKEN=pittpanther16

# Set the password to use for the Keystone admin user to "Panther$"
CONFIG_KEYSTONE_ADMIN_PW=Panther$

# Set the password to use for the Keystone demo user to "Panther$"
CONFIG_KEYSTONE_DEMO_PW=Panther$

# Make sure the type of identity backend is sql for now (in the future we shall use LDAP)
CONFIG_KEYSTONE_IDENTITY_BACKEND=sql

# Set the Keystone LDAP backend URL to that of the Controller node
CONFIG_KEYSTONE_LDAP_URL=ldap://192.168.0.103

# Looking through the configuration you will see several other passwords. The defaults for these can
# be used. We can always refer to this file to retrieve the passwords

# Save the file, if you're using VIM then:
Press ESC
:wq!

# We are now ready to deploy!
packstack --answer-file=/root/answers.txt

# It will now prompt you for all of your root passwords for 
# the 3 nodes
